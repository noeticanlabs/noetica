# Noetica Kernels (Combined)

This super-repo structure combines:
- CK-0 coherence kernel (governance contract)
- NK-0 noetica kernel (execution substrate)

Recommended integration model:
- `ck0/` as subtree or submodule to `../ck0-coherence-kernel`
- `nk0/` as subtree or submodule to `../nk0-noetica-kernel`

The normative bridge is documented in `SPEC/kernel_contract.md`.
